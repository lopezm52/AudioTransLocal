  "text": "Recently I've been through the past 15 years and I'm on my way to visit for several months. I was always through to travel from désar Wireless... For the first time, I'm all a bit like my family Mac door Hello, good morning, how are you? I'm good, I'm good, sorry for letting me do something. So, I'll just point it up. No problem, no problem. Are you doing? Yeah, thank you. Has a good day in Malah. So, very refreshing. You have worked very. A few days in Malah, in the Eastern Rey, ah, nice. That's how you feel, right? Yeah, that's home for me. Mm-hmm. Cool. Okay, drop a... I would like to talk to you about three topics. One is the team that we are having in the BSO. The other one is the gold team. So, what can we do more, maybe in the gold team or maybe change something? And the third one is about my contribution. So, I would like to review with you my contribution. Mm-hmm. Okay, so, starting with the team, I don't know if you have feedback about the current setup, if it's okay that we keep the people. We have Alga, Casia, Mark, Angana. Very well connected now with the value stream. So, they are contributing a lot. They are part of the enabling teams. And I also help in them with different activities we are planning. We are not so lucky with charatee, with Alexei or with Nick. Those are the three areas where we are not connecting well at the moment. I use in yo, for example, activities with access, with Ana, especially in the topics that are US related. And José Carlos and Noemi, they are doing some little work for some people in Alexei's team, but to be honest, not so much. So, this is the current situation of the team. I don't know if you have feedback about that. So, we continue, boost something. Look, I think that, for me, and when I think about the journey, I think change management, it's always hard to kind of say that we have got 100% on the journey. But usually statistically, if you are able to make a movement with 60%, the rest will be forced to follow, because that's enough momentum to get change. So, if things are genuinely hard, let's focus on the areas that we can really accelerate and make the biggest impact on, because that's time spent, which we know we can achieve in outcome with. And then my expectation is that the rest will somewhat follow. So, I think there's a few things which I'll look at. I must admit, I don't know what's going on with Schrad and where all that's ended up. I've actually thought that we were having momentum with him in Q4 last year, so I don't know what happened or what fell away or what's occurred there. So, I'd be curious to understand. I do think with Nick and Alexei, we do need to figure something out. I'll say where, actually with Alexei, the value stream oriented approach actually, I think he's progressing it. The way that he's turning up, the way that the product, the product's attorney-up, is part of the value stream. It's continually presented really quite well. And when I speak with the product line leads, they're actually really quite happy with the way that Alexei and the product managers are partnering with them as part of the value stream model. And even the way that we see it turning up in the Diaportfolio, it's continually stream aligned. So, whether they're ways of working in terms of delivery or aligned is one question, but certainly the way that it's turning up in terms of it being oriented to the value stream, actually I'm quite happy to see it. And from a mindset perspective when I speak with Alexei, he's worked hard on his own mindset compared to last year in terms of orienting towards that. And even when I speak with our stakeholders, they also see it turning up in the right way. So if we speak with customer service, they don't see two different organisations, they see it turning up as one. Also Robert, Derek, and Alexei, they look like they're working as a team. And same thing with, I think, Diago, I think that Diago is provided me, quite a lot of feedback that he's quite satisfied with the way that this is turning up together. So, yeah, there's probably some elements which I'd say it'd be good to make sure that they're not creating a different organisation. But the way that it's turning up, it's oriented approach from quite satisfied with it. Hi, I agree. Especially the product managers are very well connected with the value streams. We see them in every meeting that we do with the value streams and they have the people from their tending side. Yeah, now on the armicide, I can't say the same thing. Actually, I'm quite frustrated. Yeah, I'm quite frustrated. But that's a bit of a leadership problem to be honest with you. I think that Jackie hasn't invested any time herself off. And I think she quite intentionally chooses not to. And so that's quite a challenge. I would say, so it's not. From a neck perspective, I don't think he's intentionally not turning up. I just don't think that Jackie's made it any kind of priority for that to happen. So, you know, in two weeks time when I was, you know, Diego and Ramesh, their product lines, which is also the value stream of customer engagement sales marketing, we've got all of the data product managers in Nick there. I'll be setting a very clear expectation around how that turns up and how we sit this way together. I've set the same expectation from how it turns up as a portfolio. But I can tell you one of the biggest problems I've got now is the data team taking decisions which are contrary to the value stream. Actually, it created me a big headache and they take a decision. They do their own thing, but the headache is with us. And this, it's not turning up well. It's not turning up well. So, I have really quite a challenge on the farmer side of things, but I don't think it's because of the people that we've got turning up from the VIA. So, I think that this is actually the root cause of that is actually a different leadership problem that we've got. So, I think we should focus on where we can have impact. And I think that what I would like to see on the farmer space is at least the customer engagement value stream. Let's focus on getting that set up well and properly with the data alignment. Because we need good working examples. It's hard for me to say Jackie, hey, do it. I'd much rather say do it and here's what it looks like working effectively. Because if we don't have a good working example, then it's a pardon. For some reason, she won't look at diagnostics as a good working example. It needs to turn up within what she sees as like a farmer lens. Yeah, that would just be my take and I think it's worth spending time with Alexie and just trying to figure out what he is doing. Like, is it drastically different? Or is it somewhat the same better different mind which may be yours? I'm not sure. I don't see it being drastically different. But he likes to present his strategy and his thing which makes it look different. But is it really from an uncompenspective of what we're trying to achieve? Is it really different? I'm not sure. I don't actually have any facts on the title to be a judge about that. The only controversial topic was the run versus activities that need to go into the portfolio. I also had conversation with the people in the in that area. They wanted to have more and more into run and less and less into the portfolio. So there is not a lot of visibility. What you've been, sorry? So in the data and inside the Alexis area, the threat hold for run is pretty high. So what they are putting in the portfolio is quite a small one. Because they are doing a lot of development inside the run cause. Okay, so it's just they're not being true. That is a way you may not be transparent. Exactly. So we don't have enough transparency of how much they are developing because they consider a lot like run cost. Yeah, fair enough. I think that Alexis is going to get squeezed at the moment anyway. So I think that by being squeezed, more transparency will come to. We somehow need to have a better way of getting this transparency because just the direction of your for Maddox is actually helping the situation. We're not looking at what a team does. We're trying to kind of see how it turns up in the financial system and stuff like that. And somehow we need to kind of recognise and understand the activity and the productivity of teams rather than like pulling apart resources from a financial lens and thinking that we actually understand the work. So I don't know how to achieve that. I also, you know, I really believe you know, like we did when we were workshopping. In productivity is really important to understand that none of the metrics that we have in place today give us any kind of indication of team productivity. And that's something which I want to know how productive the team is and how we make it all productive in the future. Should be part of the success factor. So you know, things that we're talking about with is for me it's not just about run and new business capability. There's multiple elements of that. It's like, what is the quality of the user story turning into a real product? Yeah, right. Because when we've got quality issues or non-productive teams, this poor quality at needs to be re-done because, you know, it's got testing issues and also not having the things. So measuring that, that also measuring, you know, the one thing that I really love in scrum is this evidence-based management. And it's a very objective way of measuring what value we're trying to create, what is the current value. But also our ability to turn the things into new value and our ability to innovate. And I just feel as though the way the way looking at teams at the moment, we're not looking at that at all. We're only looking at how much it costs. Yes, actually. And I would love to see us get some more productivity measures in there because I think that that's where we're going to get transparency from. Yeah. And you know, one thing which, you know, it's just we hear at the Epic's DeAco slides. Yes, today. You know, we did this managed service with Accenture. And before we all we really had transparency of this like, um, uh, headcount costs, individuals, problems and tickets and these kinds of things. But no productivity measures, right? But now the way that Accenture is working, because they're thinking about automation, you totally get productivity measures being baked. So they're using, so every iteration or every PI that they're doing, they're saying, what more can we automate? So now they're using Gen AI for use case development, for test case development, for self-healing. And all of that, you know, is actually making it more efficient. And we can see that because we just did a release and it's been the most efficient, seamless release we've ever done. Wow. And it's because they're focusing on the automation, the taking away of the manual activities and making the team actually more productive than what they've been before. And I think we need to lean into this a little bit more to kind of say, how can that be more scalable? Because that for me, it's not so much a run-crossed first, you know, new business capability. If we can actually increase that productivity, we're going to automatically get that transition from run into new business capability in a more transparent way. Excellent. And so I think it's worth us looking at that more. Because I actually think that that is what Alexie is thinking and trying to do. You know, he's trained not to get lost in the complexity of run versus NBC. He's trying to actually look at increasing the productivity of teams, which I appreciate it, right? So I think it's worth us looking into that and maybe having some kind of insight as to what we're measuring why we're measuring at what we want out of it. But I think productivity seems to be the hardest thing to get to, but it's what we want. I think what is happening is because there's a cost pressure, we, because we can't measure productivity and what we're producing, we're automatically thinking that people are doing the wrong thing. Yeah. Which is creating additional overhead. So it's always taking us backwards. We're doing things up on the ground. Yeah, I agree. Where I have seen this working is when you are able to do an analysis put together a plant and then say, okay, from this day, we're going to do things differently in that team. And then things have started to change. You cannot just introduce, now you need to measure this, now you need to do that. It's like let's have a plan unless it's started from day one that day. Yeah. Yeah. So I would really love and look, I think we need to do it with willing teams, right? Because the unwilling teams, they will fall behind, but they'll almost be forced to catch up, just by seeing good work done. Like for the good working, you know, if we've done our team topologies, if we've really brought things into other scram or, or like a, a jaw release train or something, how do we start to look at productivity measures and how can we see if it's improving and what we're doing to actually improve that. Like this, I do believe that that may be the conversation that Alexi wants to have. It doesn't want to be forced into something, but how can we work with it to kind of understand what is the right thing? So that that would be, you know, something that I think is really worth looking into. So what do you think going to the second and third topic maybe together? We have to minutes, what do you think is still our role in the go team to do and what is my contribution? How can I contribute more? Because I was also feeling that maybe I can help more in other areas to put some extractor, maybe in something that you are putting together in commercial. I really love a state commercial and would like to contribute more. You know, one of the things which you might be anxious about is the whole workforce planning sort of things. You know, we've kind of identified the workforce as like a key point. And I think that this was something between the practice side of things and the workforce, like the team topology and kind of setting up good teams was, I'd say, what we kind of said was more part of practices, but then the workforce, it looks like a different thing, but for me I don't think it's totally different. And upcoming, you know, this workshop that we've got upcoming and Mark is part of it. I'm wondering how do we get the workforce people and Mark together to start thinking about, how do we actually facilitate the future workforce orientation so that we, like, I don't want to get to this workshop and for it to feel like, what are we just thinking about it? And what do I mean by that? Like we've got all of the product managers together, the values, extremely, it's the product line leads together, portfolio. And what we're doing is we're looking at business strategy, translated to portfolio and confirming that. We're then going to look at technology, future state, and what we want to get out of that. And then we're looking at workforce, and somehow we need to come up with a workforce strategy out of that. Now, don't believe it's just locations, these kinds of things. It's also, for me, about the practices, the measures of productivity, like, what we need to get out of the workforce, not just what is the composition of the workforce. And I think that this, for me, is still a little bit abstract for me, exactly how we should run that workshop. And Nathan is one of his team members, he's kind of leading that, but I don't know where they're at. I don't know if Mark and him have come together to think about the facilitation of that. I'm trying to speak with the architects as well to say, hey, when we're doing future state technology road maps, we then need to think about workforce implications of doing these things. I want to make sure that we're not saying it as like individual pieces, but rather building blocks of creating something as a whole. And look, we've only got a bit over a week until we run this workshop, but I'm still, it's still a little bit ambiguous for me how that turns out. And Magnith and Jackie are really looking at the outcome of this as to what they should be doing for the rest of their teams. And so it's an opportunity for us to actually have a very good working example of what we want to go away and do. So that's something that, like, I don't know how much engagement you're having with Mark on these things, but this is where I'd love to make sure that he's really well equipped along with the workforce person and the others who are going to lead that section, that part of the workshop, to make sure that we are not going into it and going, trying to figure out at that point of time how we're going to do it. Rather we go into it with the incremental building blocks of the strategy, the portfolio, the technology, and then the workforce, you know, exactly what we're aiming to achieve with the go team concept. I'm not sure I don't see the interactions between them to know whether they're doing or what that preplanning so that we're turning up to facilitate the development of it rather than to facilitate how we're going to do it. Do you know what I mean? I want the help of work down in advance so that we're turning up, we're actually designing the future workforce strategy. Okay. So yesterday I had the similar conversation with Yago about that. So do you think what we're helping is to bring, for example, all the offerings that bend on management and procurement and the workforce part of the AIAX excellent is providing? To me, we can't look at workforce as like chapter people or domain people or the services. The whole thing is the whole, right? Let's think about it. This is how we produce something. Exactly. And so if we just look at the different elements in isolation, we always get an imbalance of what we're trying to achieve. So for me, looking at a portfolio and saying, what are really those late stage life cycles, things that we can move into a full maintenance mode, is there a way to package that up into a really efficient service? And what fluid that work into a managed work so that the product managers, that isn't an active card of their day, they can rely on that from more of a ensuring the service is performing. We then need to look at the portfolio for the next three years to say, what are really these growth areas that we need to be investing into? Right? Where do we want SIs to play a role? Where do we want to actually ensure that we've got the technical expertise in house to do this better than what we have before? And that way we can start to chart not with the two month lens or three month lens, but rather with a 12 to three, 12 months to three years lens, give ourselves the opportunity to actually build these things with the right people, with the right capability and also understand where we want SIs partners to play a role. So I think without looking at it as a whole, it's always looking at it as a resource plan, or just one managed service or something like that, it's got to be holistic if it's something that we're going to own together and execute together. And for me, I would much rather walk away from that session with the goal that the product managers, the PLLs, jointly own in execution. No, this is me in my own product, or that's you in your product, and that's what your thing is, and that's what my thing is, like that's not going to work because we'll never get economies of scale out of it. And this is where I really want to do some critical thinking before hand, how do we craft that session in a way that we're really going to have an outcome of it? And I think that the Epic's managed service is a good, good working example where, actually by packaging it up across products, we really have got an economy of scale, we really are getting year on year, it's getting cheaper, it's not getting more expensive, and by that being managed effectively, it means that we now focused our brain capacity is now focused on what's next, not how do we run that, you know, with all the overhead of managing individual contractors, our source. And so I think that we've got to look at these persons that are going to exist and also, you know, like what brand and have been doing, how do we categorize our applications and stuff to make sure that we look at them as a whole rather than just as individuals. So it doesn't need to be perfect, but we need to do some of that critical thinking in advance to make sure that we're really set up well because I want that experience to be good for the product managers, but to be honest with you, I want to lift the ambition with this. So if that experience and we get like very kind of poor output, it doesn't give maybe opportunity to raise the bar, I want the opportunity to raise the bar, and I think that what we do from a facilitation and set up perspective is going to be 100% critical on that. Okay, interesting. What I like was what you're saying is that sounds to me like this is going to be important, whatever changes are coming from Waffa, right? Because this is going to happen anyway, not need to happen. You know, I kind of said this to, you know, rematch Diego and Magnus yesterday, like we don't know what's coming. I don't actually, I don't think Steve does. But the best way we have a plan that we're executing, the more that we stay focused, no matter what changes come. So this is something that should be durable regardless of what organizational changes happen. So we have the opportunity to equip ourselves to navigate change. If we go into this well, it's going to be chaos, if something changes. So I don't want to say that everything's going to change, but the better we've actually got a plan and that we're actually executing a plan, the better that we can weather any storm. Yeah, I liked that. I see I see this as an important topic that we'll remind important, the first sure. Yeah, very good. And we don't have too much time left, but you're also wondering if you beat that for yourself as well, right? Yes. You know, I probably did the main thing that I see with you, actually. I think that you're deeply thoughtful in the way that you go about things. And you know, I can see that you really play the cultural, in a very strong way. I sometimes feel as though you may overuse the coaching role. And what do I mean by that? Like, I think that what you can strengthen is your direction. How can you make sure that it's not coaching to like and continue coaching, hoping that an outcome comes? How can you be more clear in your direction about what you expect to see and then coach towards that? Okay. And I think that sometimes in my experience, I think with the diary, and other things, if we're open-ended on something, without a clear outcome, things going all different directions. And actually, I think we have a direction, but it was disregarded. And I wasn't here. I actually think that, you know, the way that things were set up with others, they disregarded it and almost started all over again. I feel it takes us backwards. So you can't have agility without direction. You can't have agility without clear outcomes. So let's make sure that, and I think that this is where you can play a really key role. How do you make sure when you're, and you do play the coaching role very well? How can you also imbalance how that more clarity on outcome, more clarity on direction? So that we're working, we're doing coaching within a certain guardrail, not opening up the guardrail to see what comfort. And I think that, I don't know if that makes sense or not, but I think we're doing this with a very big difference. Okay, it does not, thank you very much, and that's resonating a lot, because you're right, that sometimes it's like, okay, I feel like I can give people my opinion, but people will do whatever they, but no, and maybe they can go more into that action we need them to call. Yeah, so yeah, I think that when you don't have clear direction or when you, it doesn't feel like you're pushing towards something, and I know that some of that language may sound reactive, but I'm trying to think of the right term, it doesn't feel like there's an energy behind it, it feels good, but it doesn't feel like this ambition behind it, it's stuff like that. And I kind of sense that if you can create that ambition energy, that direction energy, and then couple up with coaching people to get there, so that they own it in the end, and the elements that we need to be creative with is we are, but we have to have that element built in. So I'm going to need to duck out for another call, but I'm happy to make more frequently, if you, yes, that will help a lot to the particular matter, and I really appreciate your feedback. Yeah, and you know, if we sometimes 30 minutes is a short amount of times, I have these calls, but you know, maybe if we have lunch or something like that, we can go through a more detail. Excellent, very good. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Are you having a good day and have nice weekend? You do, bye. Cheers, see you.",
